# Super user-friendly JSON editor

Made especially for working with contractors (in my case, freelancing video editors/ non-programmers), they should be able to create json files within the given model, without knowing what json is, having to mess brackets and commas, potencially making mistakes.

- [ ] Load template from filesystem
- [ ] Template selection on start
- [X] Backup at every export
- [ ] Backup at every import
- [ ] Visual way to load backups
- [ ] Undo/Redo buttons
- [ ] Editable model (maybe from a second UI)
- [ ] Validate for non valid schema, maybe a lost '{' in the text

Open-sourcing this as I can imagine many uses for it.
